We hacked Android's built-in profiler (for the codebase AOSP 4.4.4 and 5.1.1) to automate app profiling in sampling mode.
We also hacked Android's dmtracedump utility to obtain elapsed wall clock time for app-level function calls.

To build the profiler for AOSP 4.4.4:
    mmm dalvik/vm; mmm libcore; mmm frameworks/base/cmds/am; mmm frameworks/base
     
To build the profiler for AOSP 5.1.1:
    mmm frameworks/base/cmds/am

To parse function call traces generated from app profiling (or using TraceView), run dmtracedump tools with following command:
    dmtracedump -o $input_file > $output_file

To build dmtracedump tool, compile Tracedump.c and Profile.h with the following command:
    gcc -o dmtracedump TraceDump.c
